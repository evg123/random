#variable for topicsearch
TOPIC:(topicsearch)


#Open youtube
#Search Results for each term to give search results for 'SR'  that shows 'top 5 options' , 'top 5' , 'first 5'
#Allow for infinite versions to be searched from above for the specific search to get top 5 most relevant results
#REPEAT for each 'top 5 searches' creating an endless search
#The future ones attached to them are updated with every search
#Convert 'top 5 top options' into 'variable_of_options1'
#This gives people the option to change their initial subscriptions
#First search is 'variable of options1a1'
#This should create an endless list where I can search one thing here that will give me the top 5 videos on youtube for that search
  #More examples: Every youtube account is unique bc everyone searches different things that brings out results catered to them.
  #Maybe add 'learn' to each of these initial searches. If its a a repeat twice in a row like search learn learn guitar , just show results for the first (and give options for both)
